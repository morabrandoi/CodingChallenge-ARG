/* Instructions:
 * You have been tasked to evaluate and improve code produced by an intern. The code has not been assessed by anyone yet.
 * You need to provide feedback and improve the code explaining why you made the changes and what effect they have so that the intern can learn.
 * You are expected to demonstrate how to write high quality, mature, efficient and production ready code in line with high standards and development principles.
 *
 * The business requirements for the project were:
 *      * Create a solution that analyzes data from a continuous stream.
 *      * The ideal operation is when the data generates an integer value, followed by lower one, followed by higher one, followed by lower one, etc.
 *      * In that way it generates 50% peaks. Practically, during healthy operation we get about 33% of peaks.
 *      * We need to trigger an alarm if we get fewer than 25% of peaks over any continuous set of 100 samples.
 *
 * The data comes in very fast and you need to maximize throughput and provide the outcome as soon as possible.
 * The intern decided to use a random number generator to test the code. You can alter and modify the GetDataPoint() function to suit your implementation.
 * You should provide some evaluation of the performance of your solution or at least an explanation how it should be done.
 * Please, make notes where you can think of vulnerabilities or potential issues with your implementation.
 * Your documentations must be sufficient for another engineer to implement this code into a larger application.
